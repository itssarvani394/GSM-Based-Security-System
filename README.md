The provided project is a GSM-based security system implemented using a microcontroller, keypad, LCD display, GSM module, and relay module. The system allows users to arm and disarm security features via a keypad input, with password authentication ensuring authorized access. Upon initialization, the microcontroller sets up GPIO pins, initializes UART communication for GSM module interaction, and initializes the LCD display for visual feedback. The keypad enables user input, with buttons corresponding to alphanumeric characters and special symbols. Passwords entered via the keypad are compared against generated passwords, and upon a match, the system proceeds with the designated action. Additionally, the system features a manual password generation button for backup password creation, ensuring functionality in case of keypad failure. The GSM module enables communication over the cellular network, facilitating SMS notifications for system events such as password generation. The relay module controls external devices like door locks based on system commands. Overall, the project integrates hardware components and programmed logic to create a versatile and secure GSM-based security system suitable for home or commercial use.
